// Here we will learn about different operators

//let value = 4
//let negvalue = -value;
//console.log(negvalue);

/*
console.log(2+2);
console.log(2-2);
console.log(2*2);             //these are basic operations
console.log(2**3);
console.log(2/2);
console.log(2%2);
*/

/*
let str1 = "Self - love"
let str2 = " is must.";
let str3 = str1 + str2;       //like this we can add two strings as well and also apply many other operations on strings
console.log(str3);
*/

// console.log("1"+ 2);
// console.log(1 +"2");
//console.log("1"+ 2 + 2);       /*operators works accordingly as what comes first like if at first it is srting then the*/
//console.log(1 + 2 + "2");      /* whole number will be convert to string */

// like first output will be 12
// second will be 12 as well
// third will be 122
// and fourth will be 32

/* but this is a bad practice as you are suggested to put some brackets on whatever you wanted to compute first and for good 
code readability as well LIKE BELOW */

// console.log((2+2)*(10%3));
// console.log("");


// some tricky operations that we should not use because they used to create confusion

console.log(+true);         // gives 1
// console.log(true +);    // gives error
console.log(+"");          // gives 0
